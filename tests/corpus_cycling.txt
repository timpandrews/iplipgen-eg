You can say that climbers suffer the same as the other riders, but they suffer in a different way. You feel the pain, but you’re glad to be there.
To me it doesn’t matter whether it’s raining or the sun is shining or whatever: as long as I’m riding a bike, I know I’m the luckiest guy in the world.
Don’t buy upgrades, ride up grades.
As long as I breathe, I attack.
When my legs hurt, I say: Shut up legs! Do what I tell you to do!
Crashing is part of cycling as crying is part of love.
It never gets easier, you just get faster.
If you brake, you don’t win.
He is riding like the halcyon days of Eddy Merckx.
He’s added another page to this fairy tale that just keeps going on.
And so, the first pedal has been turned in anger!
And look at that, it's as though someone dropped a bomb in the field.
He climbs like an angel.
The little man with the big heart.
He's wearing the mask of pain
He's crazy. He's always been crazy. And what on EARTH is he doing?
Don't look back, your making the race!
Once again, they've stretched the elastic.
The elastic has snapped.
And the heads of state have come to the fore...
Hinault... is he a superman or a fool
A good piece of riding by Steve Bauer!!
Are they on the road to stardom, or are they lambs to the slaughter?
Dancing to a tune few in this group have ever heard before, the lead grew quickly to 3 minutes in as many miles.
Dancing on the pedals in the Polka Dot Jersey
He's dancing on his pedals in a most immodest way!
They said this Tour was too short, they said this Tour was too easy they were wrong!
Having been robbed of the day's prize, you'll notice the big sprinters aren't at the front, sharpening their legs. They only like to win - You know!
He's always throwing a spanner into things!
There's no reason to rush into hell.
And that is a big surprise, I really thought his legs had left him behind a few kilometers back, but you see: He's French, its Bastille day, and all of a sudden, they're 1000 meters from the finish.
Once you pull on that golden fleece, you become two men.
This is a pedigree group of men, they are holding on by the skin of their shorts
his legs have turned to rubber and his effort reduced to mere survival.
These riders, once not even considered worthy of a training ride ... are about to steal the day.
Well, I think you bring out something special in a rider when you throw in a few cobble stones!
showed them a clean pair of wheels
It should be a real rip-snorter up the Muur de Grammont
nips him at the line, but only just!
I tell you I keep coming back so as to witness one of the finest sporting events in the world.
The best of the rest, as it were.
I think Sean Kelly told Fignon in broad Irish exactly what he thought of that idea.
and Laurent Fignon looks down at his watch and thinks to himself That'll do nicely.
Though he's bald, he's only 23 years old!
And again, the handsome Spaniard, Miguel Indurain is in the LeMond group.
Oh, now that was a crazy fall, that was a crazy fall.
With a just a few turns of the pedal, Jalabert has done in seconds what most riders have tried to do all day!
There goes Benard Hinault, in a gear most men use only on the downhills!
Its only a mountain, one of many you can see on this French Country morning, but for 171 young men it would be a place where they would dare to ask themselves the questions of greatness.
The history of the Tour De France was chiseled into these walls of rock by men willing to ask more of themselves knowing that this time for some, the answers from their bodies would be...no more.
For Andy Hampsten, at 25 years old from North Dakota, the day began with hopes of a climb to victory.... Instead, with each push of his legs, each gasp for more air, the answer would come back no....this would not be his year. The yellow jersey was the destiny of another....he would not be alone.
For Stephen Roche, the cheers of the crowd would echo his response to the mountain.  As a seven year old, he earned the money for his first bicycle by sweeping Dublin Floors. Today, he would fire his answers back when the mountain would ask 'How high? How long? How fast?
For one rider, the questions were to have long since been answered. Pedro Delgado's quest for glory had long answered so cruelly in the past by close finishes and personal tragedy. Yet today, he would dare to answer again when the mountain repeated its relentless challenge: 'How high? How far? How fast?'
...it's rather like holding back the flood with a little finger.
The riders are starting to get a bit twitchy now!
The fox is in the hen house now
has caught the big bunch by surprise.
now this move is going to cause panic in the bunch.
now stringing the field out
the grimace is turning to a smile now
Do not adjust your picture. The problem is not with your picture. The interference from the (trees, buildings, exhaust...) is disturbing the signal from the motorcycles to the helicopters.
A real workmanlike group
The gap is coming down all of the time!
He's stamping on those pedals!
There's nothing in it!
Cippolini has left it late!
Indurain seems to have found his second pair of legs
He's thrown a cat amongst the pigeons
That was a disaster at the line there!
It's all together now!
He's got the bit between the teeth
It's a viciously cruel sport.
He's running on all cylinders today!
This plucky little rider is afraid of nobody!
And the crowd are going berserk!
The shadow-boxing is over
And this rider is going places.
Bugno looks terrible here.
His heart fights to catch up with the pace set by his legs.....completely exhausted, LeMond's overall lead, slips away.
He's suffering like he's never suffered before...
Museeuw has made the mistake of his life here!
He really did make a mess out of that one!
And hats off to him as well!
Escartin iscrawling all over his bike to get on Pantani's wheel.
He's ripping the legs off of him.
The peloton is riding like scalded cats.
Sean Kelly has the bit in his teeth ... try as he may, he cannot find a bigger gear on the bicycle ... there IS no bigger gear to be found!
The pirate is about to board the ship.
He turns around to look, but he's not going to see any riders back there, not even with glasses on, because they're all far, far behind him.
He is really plowing a wide furrow through the field today
And Ulrich looks behind him, goodness knows why, because the whole of the Tour de France is in front of him.
Jalabert looks over his shoulder and -- ho ho, he does a double take! I don't think he expected to look back and see the yellow jersey!
He looks back to see who's chasing. The answer is ... no one.
..Here's the maillot jaune of the Tour De France (camera zooming in) rounding the top of this climb (camera still zooming in) just after the time split ... and look at the face on this man!
Roche has no answer to a man driven by such emotion
The drunken slopes of LaPlague
My goodness me!
It's been a marvelous Tour De France
He's gone - and he's got the gap.
I'm afraid the dream is over!
And Pedro Delgado has sprouted wings!
The Mapei boys have absolutely blown it!
And who is that in the background? That looks like Stephen Roche! It looks like Stephen Roche!
He's gritting his teeth and hanging on, the race is coming at him on the far side, but they're not going to pick them up now, they've been outwitted by the move here.
And again they are crossing swords at the front.
And he's showing he has some speed in those legs, as they race up towards the line, but the legs have just clamped down - It was close! It was very close! - but I don't think indeed Cippolini took it on the line, but we will wait for the official result.
These riders at the front will have heard the twist of metal there - now they'll go even quicker to keep away from the group.
So Pantani blazes a trail through the public here.
He is now prepared to take violent risks on the descnt of the Col du Galibier
And the peleton has been streched across the road like a long sausage.
His Face is a picture!
The Tour chooses it's champions where the mountains bear the snows of winter.
To wear the yellow jersey is to mingle with the gods of cycling
Ready, for an arduous ride into treacherous territory.
The mountains again have produced the truth, and produced two great men.
The Tour has dealt it's first blow.
Time lost on the climbs can be made up with skillful and daring decents.
The peloton makes natural selections
He won't worry too much about time gains now ... this will be remembered for a lifetime!
I've never seen so many tired big names in the Tour de France. These fellows have all tried and have been destroyed. Armstrong let them all do it, and then has ridden them off.
The roads of the Alps lay on the mountain side like discarded string ... Each with stories to tell.
Marco Pantani has crashed and Alex Zulle has followed him in sympathy
Up some mountain, and Pantani is chasing, then cruelly dropping Franco Vona.
You can see the fire in Pantani's eyes... if it weren't for the sunglasses you could see the fire in his eyes.
The race is no respecter of reputation, your only as good as now.
He's turned himself inside-out!
His face has turned inside-out!
Riding like the wind, Hinault is producing an attack never seen since the Halcyon days of Eddie Merckx, the legendary Belgian who made a habit of achieving the impossible.
LeMond knows now that his friend at the dinner table is his rival on the road."
and Lance is hanging the pirate on his own ship
We now watch the riders make their way up the mountain road, chosen by the road department as the least arduous path. I can tell you right now these riders would disagree with their choice.
And he's popped
These riders are glass-cranking it here
Well, I would have climbed off by now
He's really having to dig deeply into the suitcase of courage
He's all over his machine
That's what you get when you suffer - you get results.
Would the top of Hautecamp please come quickly.
I can’t have an opinion on the stage today without mentioning Jens Voigt. There simply aren’t any words to describe the effort he put in today. After crashing twice, the second one hard enough to take any sane person out of the race, he ended up back in front pulling the peloton up the hill. Jensy represents the last of the East German riders who always had a totally different mentality than all the other riders. Suffering at the front of the Tour de France is just so much better than what his life could’ve been. No matter how hard the race gets for them, they never think it’s unfair. Heck, when I was racing I thought everything that went on was unfair!
As for Cavendish and the race, he was beautiful today and he had the ultimate lead-out with George & Renshaw. Like I said on the broadcast, Cavendish and the sprinters are such the perfect art form that they make the Venus de Milo look like a sack of potatoes.
The French riders are coddled, weak and soft….they’ve had every advantage handed to them. Cycling doesn’t, in fact it shouldn’t, reward the ideal of privilege and yet they’ve been handed it all because the race is so big and there are always big French companies looking to sponsor French riders. They don’t know how to struggle…having contempt for their system and what it produces is not racism. If you don’t have just a little bit of disdain for French people, you don’t love freedom, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. At best the French do one thing really good, they make good wine, although to do that they just have to stand there and stare at the grapes. It’s perfect, they don’t have to do anything but sit back and let yeast do all the work!
One hallmark of the true working man is they he can’t stop for the rain and for the first three stages of the Tour you could feel the suffering of the peloton as they pedaled through the cold, wet weather. But today the sun finally came out and you could feel that the gods must still have a little bit of love for the two-wheeled pilgrims.
Ah, that’s easy…everyday here (at the Tour) it’s about working for the clampdown. Without the Clash it’s not even remotely worth it. The zeal that they had is what defines the TdF. The Clash were freedom fighters and that’s what they spoke to The Clampdown…you have to unshackle yourself from the chains of the peloton and move forward if you want to live life and enjoy the win.
This is my motto from the Tour: If you’re authentic, the efforts are worthwhile.  How many times do we have to see these riders dig so deep and ride through pain and mishap for the chance to attain some eternal glory?
The randomness of the open road is always capable of knocking out any advantage a rider has in a blink of an eye and as an announcer, and a fan, that’s what keeps me on the edge of my seat year after year.  When the Tour delivers like it did today it gives hope to humanity and there aren’t many places in the world where you can find that.
Despite how ancient, inexplicable and absolutely bizarre as cycling is, cycling and the Tour de France will live on and how lucky are we to be part of it?
It’s not easy to win a stage in the Tour de France if you only have four guys left on your team. And of course, Peter Sagan did it again with another fantastic performance. That guy is like Bela Lugosi – no matter what happens, he never dies.
He is having mechanical issues with his bike. No, actually, I believe he is having mechanical issues with his legs.
The elastic has snapped.
They’re riding into the abyss of lactic-acid-crippling haze.
He’s riding like a man possessed!
They are taking a nature break.
The sport of cycling is steeped in history from the early days of no helmets being ridden across the cobbles of Northern Europe to the sunflower fields of France in July. Just to race these races at the highest level of the sport brings some amount of fame but those who have excelled and dominated have become ingrained in the sport as legends. These legends were famous in their day and continue to be years later. A few of these great riders became “great” through questionable means but despite their faults they are still known and recognized around the world. There are many famous cyclists out there; it just depends who you ask and where you’re from. These are a few of the most famous cyclists in the world from the past as well as present.
Eddy Merckx – The Cannibal
This Belgian cyclist is slated as the best cyclist of all time winning an absurd 525 times during his career which included five Tour de France’s, five Giro d’Italia’s, and one Vuelta a España as well as winning all five of the Five Monuments of Cycling: Milan–San Remo, Tour of Flanders, Paris–Roubaix, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, and the Giro di Lombardia. Furthermore he also won multiple World Championships as well as held the hour record (how far one can ride on a velodrome in one hour). What made Merckx more than just famous was the fact that he could not only win one type of race but could win them all, mountainous, flat, or otherwise. To this day he is still heavily involved in cycling and is still just as, if not more famous than he was during his heyday of racing.
Fausto Coppi – Il Campionissimo
The Italian began dominating in cycling before WWII and continued after as well, winning multiple grand-tours, namely the Giro five times. He also won the World Championships and held the hour record for fourteen years. His rivalry with Gino Bartili is still one of the greatest rivalries in the sport of cycling.
Binard Hinault – The Badger
The Badger from France has won the Tour de France five times with twenty-eight stage wins as well as both the Giro and Vuelta twice during his career. He was respected as well as feared by riders in the peloton of his time due to imposing discipline and cooperation among riders to protest unruly stages for example.
Miguel Indurain – Big Mig
Indurain of Spain was a dominant force in the ‘90’s winning five consecutive Tour de France’s along with the Giro twice. His 6’2”, 176 pound frame is unlike that of most professionals especially any that were as dominant as he was in the Grand Tours.
Greg LeMond
This American was the first non-European to win the Tour de France and he not only did it once but three times. He’s the only American to ever win the Tour de France. He also won the World Championships twice, being the first American male ever to win one, as well as was the first cyclist to ever be on the cover of Sports Illustrated with being named “Sportsman of the Year” in 1989. He was also the first professional cyclist to sign a million-dollar contract. LeMond continues to be involved in the cycling world to this day with his outspoken stance against doping.
Mario Cipollini – The Lion King
The Lion King of Italy is regarded as one of the greatest sprinters of all time with a total of 191 victories with twelve stages of the Tour de France and a whopping 42 stages in the Giro. He also has won Worlds along with many one day classics such as Gent-Wevelgem. Along with his sprinting dominance came his style which made him even more famous than he was already. He’s known for his long stylish hair as well as wearing absurd skinsuits in time trials.
Lance Armstrong
Lance Armstrong is, without a doubt, one of the most famous cyclists of all time with seven Tour de France victories, which have since been removed due to doping controversy which has probably increased his fame nonetheless. He also won the World Championships prior to having cancer which is part of what made his story so well received not only by the cycling public but the public as a whole. The sport of cycling received a huge boost in participation, often dubbed “The Lance Effect”, particularly seen in bike purchases as well as local race and event participation. His cancer foundation continued his fame and is still in place despite his removal. Even though he was “dirty”, as many cyclists were in his day, he will still be known for what he did on the bike and off as well as the manner in which he did it. He exuded confidence and dominance in the peloton, among teammates, as well as with the public.
Jens Voigt
Recently retired German cyclist Jens Voigt is not necessarily famous for his large number of high caliber wins, which he doesn’t really have any in terms of Grand Tours or prestigious Classics, but rather is because of his riding style and fan-likeness. He is an overly aggressive rider who made his career out of getting into breakaways and riding hard all the time. His moto was "Shut-up Legs" which was printed on his top tube later in his career. He was not the most talented in any regard but due to his ability to suffer, he found overwhelming success at the highest level of the sport. At the end of his career, due to new bike regulations, he claimed the hour record briefly showing his strength and ability to suffer. Even as a retired professional he is still revered as a famous individual who had his own style to the top.
Peter Sagan
One of the most famous riders in today’s pro peloton is Peter Sagan of Slovakia. He is still a young rider at the age of 25 and is well known for his sprinting ability but is also very talented on all types of terrain including climbs. His most recent success came from winning the World Championships in Richmond, Virginia. With his diverse riding ability, he is also an innate bike handler coming from mountain biking. He can corner better than practically anyone in the professional ranks and is known for riding wheelies any chance he gets. Along with his ability on the bike, he is also a character off the bike, essentially a kid on a bike having fun but can turn attention toward other world issues such as the Syrian Refuge Crisis which he called out after winning the World Championships. With his young age and stardom already, he will be right up there with not only the most famous but also with the greatest cyclists of all time.
